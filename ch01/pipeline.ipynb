Each piece of data provides a small window into a limited aspect of reality. The collection of all these observations gives us a picture of the whole. But the picture is messy because it is composed of a thousand little pieces, and there's always measurment noise and missing pieces."

Perhaps less obvious is the fact that they are also tied to the model; some models are more appropriate for some types of features, and vice versa. The right features are relevant to the task at hand and should be easy for the model to ingest. Feature engineering is the process of formulating the most appropriate features given the data, the model, and the task. \n",

This is a double-jointed lever, and the choice of one affects the other. Good features make the subsequent modeling step easy and the resulting model more capable of completing the desired task. Bad features may require a much more complicated model to achieve the same level of performance ( the model is now doing some feature engineering under the hood)."
