"Still, the general notion that interference is mainly due to cue overload at the time of retrieval lived on, despite the fact that multiple efforts to demonstrate that cue-overload effects apply to everyday forgetting (not just laboratory forgetting) generally suggested just the opposite (Underwood & Ekstrand, 1967). In fact, the only reason to believe that cue-overload effects play any role at all in everyday forgetting is that almost everyone can point to a few examples from their own lives where it surely does. But the mere fact that cue-overload effects sometimes play a role does not mean that the role is a substantial one.

The other condition ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ a selective differential ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ is clearly met. Hydropower development has profoundly changed freshwater environmental conditions experienced by Snake River fall Chinook salmon, so ample reason exists to believe that selective pressures for age at smolting could have changed as well. Our analyses suggest that the possibility of rapid evolutionary change in juvenile migration tactic within the last 50‚Äö√Ñ√¨60 years. Credence is lent to this hypothesis by research that has concluded that evolutionary changes have been experienced by introduced Chinook salmon populations over a 90-year period in New Zealand. There, Unwin et al.

"The real-world spaces that surround information users have been diversely called everything from personal information environments (Kwasnik, 1991; Malone, 1983) to personal information management (PIM) systems (Barreau, 1995) and personal spaces of information (Jones, 2007). Drawing upon interviews with academics, Lee (2003) proposes a model of three concentric zones of information that surround a user: “immediate,” within arm’s reach or a few footsteps away; “adjacent,” such as a nearby university library; and “outside,” such as a more distant bookstore. Speaking largely from an objectifying stance and adopting Lee’s concept of the “immediate information space,” this paper focuses on a visual research method—photography— that seems particularly well suited to learning more about settings and their accompanying information phenomena. A variety of investigative approaches may be used to study immediate information space. Jones (2007) suggests ethnography combined with design methodologies, and places emphasis on context and situation, including contextual inquiry (Beyer & Holtzblatt, 1998), situated activity (Suchman, 1983), and situated design (Greenbaum & Kyng, 1991). Naumer and Fisher (2007) recommend naturalistic inquiry (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) and the data-gathering methods of unobtrusive observation, interviews, diaries, text analysis, pictures, and videos.

"Arctic ground squirrel populations in the boreal forest are smaller (Donker and Krebs 2011) and appear to exhibit demographic characteristics indicative of sink habitat types. The extirpation of ground squirrels from the boreal forest (Gillis et al. 2005; Donker and Krebs 2011), poor active-season survival, low recruitment rates, immigration from nearby low elevation-meadow habitat and population growth rates <1.0 provide convincing evidence that the boreal forest functions as a sink habitat for arctic ground squirrels. Conversely, arctic ground squirrel populations in nearby low elevation-meadow habitat appear to be stable and self-sustaining and appear to function as sources for populations in the boreal forest. Juveniles in the present study moved from low elevationmeadow habitat into boreal forest habitat, which suggests that low-elevation meadows have the capacity to support a nearby population sink.
